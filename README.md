# Vz-Printhead-Printed-MGN12H_MGN9H-V2 for orbiter 1.5
Vz-Printhead-Printed MGN12H_MGN9H-V2 New

This Print Printed Head is to user be able to use Orbiter 1.5 with the Vzbot print printed head
the big change is on back plate and the adin of the extruder adapter plat. this print head grow on back 4mm, but all the parts ar compatible
the ducts need a bigger join its avalable on stls
the top plat is compatible with MGN12H and MGN9H ( later MGN12C and MGN9C vertion will be avalable to)

The top plate its design to use thin flat M3 bolts.

We need help from the community to test and report feedback. Use at your own risk

The Vz-Printhead is a light weight and stiff head made for the VzBoTs, with MGN12H an C on X Axis. It was designed to be compatible with almost all hotends, and extruders out there. With the height adjustable fan duct, you can easily change your config without having to re-print a new fan duct.

In this Mood, the top plate is to MGN12 H or MGN9 H to fit Orbiter 1.5 extruder but cam be used for others since is the same plate, only back plate changes, all the duct etc are the same, for that reason those parts are not available here.

here are all parts for the mood.

Note this mood uses 4 M3x45mm screws and 4 M3 lock nuts

It is available Good with description of the parts to facilitate the assembly.

Note, it may be necessary to print extra parts depending on the hotend to use, the extra parts in the STL folders are for Goliath and Rapido, also the new CPAP duct to print as well.

Spacers and so on, can be edited in cad and exported for printing, if any user can't edit I'll be happy to help edit and export the essentials.

in the extra parts folder, the head doc for Klicky prob and NRG versions will also be available
